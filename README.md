Project Summary: Movie Data Analysis Using Python

This project involves analyzing movie data to derive insights into factors influencing movie success, such as budget, gross earnings, and ratings. The analysis utilizes Python libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and statistical modeling.


Project Overview:
Data Source: The project uses a dataset sourced from movie records.
Data Cleaning: Initial data cleaning involved handling missing values and ensuring data integrity by converting appropriate columns to the correct data types.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Utilized Pandas for data manipulation and Seaborn/Matplotlib for visualization to explore relationships between variables like budget, gross earnings, and ratings.
Data Visualization: Created visualizations such as box plots to identify outliers in budget and gross earnings, and regression plots to examine correlations between variables.
Insights and Interpretation: Analyzed the relationships between budget, gross earnings, and ratings to draw insights into factors contributing to movie success.


Key Findings:
Budget vs Gross Earnings: Found a positive correlation between budget and gross earnings, suggesting that higher-budget movies tend to earn more.
Outlier Detection: Identified and removed outliers in budget and gross earnings to improve data reliability.
Impact of Ratings: Explored how movie ratings correlate with gross earnings, providing insights into audience preferences.


Technologies Used:
Python Libraries: Pandas for data manipulation, NumPy for numerical operations, Seaborn and Matplotlib for data visualization.
Data Handling: Techniques such as data cleaning, type conversion, and outlier detection were employed to ensure data quality.
